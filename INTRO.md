## Welcome to Codex

This is Codex.  It's a place for Stark & Wayne engineers to share the best
practices of setting up environments for open source Cloud Foundry using
specific techniques that give users additional value outside the day-to-day
value that simply using BOSH and Cloud Foundry might bring.

Each environment gets the benefit of:

* Agility and Resiliency for BOSH using a Proto-BOSH pattern
* Backups and Restores with [SHIELD][shield]
* Advanced Monitoring with the [Bolo][bolo] Platform
* Secure template driven manifests using [Genesis][genesis], [Spruce][spruce] and [Vault][vault]

### Infrastructure Guides

There are guides for each major Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, OpenStack, vSphere),
etc. that are usable for people who are either Stark & Wayne employees, clients
of Stark & Wayne, or interested parties.

### Updates

Please use the [gitbook discussions][discussions] or [github issues][issues] to give
feedback or questions.
