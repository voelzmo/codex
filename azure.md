# Part II - Deploying on Azure

Welcome to the Stark & Wayne guide to deploying Cloud Foundry on Microsoft Azure.

## Things You'll Need

 1. Your Azure Subscription ID
 2. Your Azure Client ID
 3. Your Azure Client Secret
 4. Your Azure Tenant ID

 To find these credentials, follow closely the Creating Credentials section here: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html

 One last thing you'll need:
 5. A name for your Azure Resource Group

## Creating an Azure Cloud via Terraform

 In the terraform/azure directory of this repo, create a file called `azure.tfvars` and enter the above values in the following format:

 ```
 subscription_id = "..."
 client_id = "..."
 client_secret = "..."
 tenant_id = "..."
 resource_group_name = "..."
 ```
 If you need to change the region of your Azure cloud or the network prefix, you can override the defaults by adding:

 ```
 aws_region = "East US"
 network = "10.39"
 ```

 See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/ for a list of available Azure regions. 

 As a quick pre-flight check, run `make manifest` to compile your Terraform plan and suss out any issues with naming, missing variables, configuration, etc.:

 ```
 make manifest
 ```

 If everything worked out you should se a summary of the plan.  If this is the first time you've done this, all of your changes should be additions.  

 Now we pull the trigger: 
 ```
 make deploy
 ```

 Terraform will connect to your Azure account and build our Bastion host, a NAT box, subnets, and Security Groups. 

### Accessing the Bastion host
 
 You now need to find the IP address of your Bastion host: </br>
 In your Azure dashboard, click Resource Groups on the left sidebar and then click on your resource group. 
 In the list of resources in this resource group, click `bastionvm`. 
 The IP address will appear under `Public IP address`. 

 The default username for this machine is `ops` and the default password is `c1oudc0w!`

 Access the Bastion host using these credentials via `ssh`. 

### Add SSH Keys to Bastion Host
TODO
 

### Installing the Necessary Packages on the Bastion Host via Jumpbox
